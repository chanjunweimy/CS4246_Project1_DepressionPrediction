	Depression is a worrying issue in modern times. If left unregulated, it can be dentrimental both health and life. \\
	
	In this report, we illustrate the use of Gaussian Processes to calculate and model stress levels in society and with the data obtained, is used to estimate depression severity.

	\section{Introduction}
	For our experiment, we will use the Gaussian Process (GP) model to measure and compute depression severity via audio recordings. We will also be discussing about the desirable properties of the GP model, detailed applications of the model towards depression severity, advantages of using the model and finally future improvement as well as how our analysis can contribute to the public. \\
