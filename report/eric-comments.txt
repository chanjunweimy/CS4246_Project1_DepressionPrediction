Well written intro and abstract.

	The aim of the present study is to determine if acoustic measures of voice, characterizing specific spectral and timing proerties, predict predetermined clinical ratings of depression severity on the PHQ-8 scale in a sample of patients, using an existing dataset of their voice recordings.
	
I think we need to add in the words GP inside ^ the sentence, that its not just using the acoustic measures but also using GP model to perform the prediction. And I think when we mention GP we can go the -
Gaussian Process(GP)

A new state of the art machine learning model?
I do not think GP is new.

I am also not sure if "an average working human mood" is correct. And i dont quite get the meaning.

trying to prediction on depression.
Should be predict not prediction.

What are the differences between sounds?
Too informal for a report

c) Automatic Relevance Detection(ARD) Kernels
^ Remove the word Kernels, to maintain consistency.

1. K-nearest Neighbours Algorithm
^ Caps the first letter for consistency

Feature Selection to be moved downwards to experiment as i think we should not put too much attention to FS. Also to be shortened.
^ I have already done the move, If you disagree we can discuss it!

Hypothesis: Doing feature selection before...
I am not sure if we want to use this hypothesis. Doing feature selection before ARD is reduantant as ARD performs the relevance filtering inside of 
its training. 
I think the first hypothesis should be that GP, specifically ARD, Matern and Dot Product will train a good model to predict PHQ-8 Scores.

Hypothesis: MFCC ...
I think we should make the distinction between audio features and features. So as to make it clear. MFCC is an audio feature, and that corresponds to 12 features. We should mention audio feature in this section.
