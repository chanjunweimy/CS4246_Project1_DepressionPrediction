@article{Cawley2014,
    abstract = {Kernel learning methods, whether Bayesian or frequentist, typically involve multiple levels of inference, with the coefficients of the kernel expansion being determined at the first level and the kernel and regularisation parameters carefully tuned at the second level, a process known as model selection. Model selection for kernel machines is commonly performed via optimisation of a suitable model selection criterion, often based on cross-validation or theoretical performance bounds. However, if there are a large number of kernel parameters, as for instance in the case of automatic relevance determination (ARD), there is a substantial risk of over-fitting the model selection criterion, resulting in poor generalisation performance. In this paper we investigate the possibility of learning the kernel, for the Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier, at the first level of inference, i.e.parameter optimisation. The kernel parameters and the coefficients of the kernel expansion are jointly optimised at the first level of inference, minimising a training criterion with an additional regularisation term acting on the kernel parameters. The key advantage of this approach is that the values of only two regularisation parameters need be determined in model selection, substantially alleviating the problem of over-fitting the model selection criterion. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated using a suite of synthetic and real-world binary classification benchmark problems, where kernel learning at the first level of inference is shown to be statistically superior to the conventional approach, improves on our previous work (Cawley and Talbot, 2007) and is competitive with Multiple Kernel Learning approaches, but with reduced computational expense. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

    abstract = {Variable and feature selection have become the focus of much research in areas of application for which datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of variables are available. These areas include text processing of internet documents, gene expression array analysis, and combinatorial chemistry. The objective of variable selection is three-fold: improving the prediction performance of the pre- dictors, providing faster andmore cost-effective predictors, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data. The contributions of this special issue cover a wide range of aspects of such problems: providing a better definition of the objective function, feature construction, feature ranking, multivariate feature selection, efficient search methods, and feature validity assessment methods.},

@article{Stratou2015,
    abstract = {Recently there has been arising interest in automatically recognizing nonverbal behaviors that are linked with psychological conditions. Work in this direction has shown great potential for cases such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), however most of the times gender differences have not been explored. In this paper, we show that gender plays an important role in the automatic assessment of psychological conditions such as depression and PTSD. We identify a directly interpretable and intuitive set of predictive indicators, selected from three general categories of nonverbal behaviors: affect, expression variability and motor variability. For the analysis, we employ a semi-structured virtual human interview dataset which includes 53 video recorded interactions. Our experiments on automatic classification of psychological conditions show that a gender-dependent approach significantly improves the performance over a gender agnostic one.},

abstract = {Recently, increasing attention has been directed to the study of the emotional content of speech signals, and hence, many systems have been proposed to identify the emotional content of a spoken utterance. This paper is a survey of speech emotion classification addressing three important aspects of the design of a speech emotion recognition system. The first one is the choice of suitable features for speech representation. The second issue is the design of an appropriate classification scheme and the third issue is the proper preparation of an emotional speech database for evaluating system performance. Conclusions about the performance and limitations of current speech emotion recognition systems are discussed in the last section of this survey. This section also suggests possible ways of improving speech emotion recognition systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
