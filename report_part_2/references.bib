@article{Cawley2014,
    abstract = {Kernel learning methods, whether Bayesian or frequentist, typically involve multiple levels of inference, with the coefficients of the kernel expansion being determined at the first level and the kernel and regularisation parameters carefully tuned at the second level, a process known as model selection. Model selection for kernel machines is commonly performed via optimisation of a suitable model selection criterion, often based on cross-validation or theoretical performance bounds. However, if there are a large number of kernel parameters, as for instance in the case of automatic relevance determination (ARD), there is a substantial risk of over-fitting the model selection criterion, resulting in poor generalisation performance. In this paper we investigate the possibility of learning the kernel, for the Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier, at the first level of inference, i.e.parameter optimisation. The kernel parameters and the coefficients of the kernel expansion are jointly optimised at the first level of inference, minimising a training criterion with an additional regularisation term acting on the kernel parameters. The key advantage of this approach is that the values of only two regularisation parameters need be determined in model selection, substantially alleviating the problem of over-fitting the model selection criterion. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated using a suite of synthetic and real-world binary classification benchmark problems, where kernel learning at the first level of inference is shown to be statistically superior to the conventional approach, improves on our previous work (Cawley and Talbot, 2007) and is competitive with Multiple Kernel Learning approaches, but with reduced computational expense. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Work in this direction has shown great potential for cases such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), however most of the times gender differences have not been explored. In this paper, we show that gender plays an important role in the automatic assessment of psychological conditions such as depression and PTSD. We identify a directly interpretable and intuitive set of predictive indicators, selected from three general categories of nonverbal behaviors: affect, expression variability and motor variability. For the analysis, we employ a semi-structured virtual human interview dataset which includes 53 video recorded interactions. Our experiments on automatic classification of psychological conditions show that a gender-dependent approach significantly improves the performance over a gender agnostic one.},

This paper is a survey of speech emotion classification addressing three important aspects of the design of a speech emotion recognition system. The first one is the choice of suitable features for speech representation. The second issue is the design of an appropriate classification scheme and the third issue is the proper preparation of an emotional speech database for evaluating system performance. Conclusions about the performance and limitations of current speech emotion recognition systems are discussed in the last section of this survey.

@article{Cummins2015,
    abstract = {This paper is the first review into the automatic analysis of speech for use as an objective predictor of depression and suicidality. Both conditions are major public health concerns; depression has long been recognised as a prominent cause of disability and burden worldwide, whilst suicide is a misunderstood and complex course of death that strongly impacts the quality of life and mental health of the families and communities left behind. Despite this prevalence the diagnosis of depression and assessment of suicide risk, due to their complex clinical characterisations, are difficult tasks, nominally achieved by the categorical assessment of a set of specific symptoms. However many of the key symptoms of either condition, such as altered mood and motivation, are not physical in nature; therefore assigning a categorical score to them introduces a range of subjective biases to the diagnostic procedure. Due to these difficulties, research into finding a set of biological, physiological and behavioural markers to aid clinical assessment is gaining in popularity. This review starts by building the case for speech to be considered a key objective marker for both conditions; reviewing current diagnostic and assessment methods for depression and suicidality including key non-speech biological, physiological and behavioural markers and highlighting the expected cognitive and physiological changes associated with both conditions which affect speech production. We then review the key characteristics; size, associated clinical scores and collection paradigm, of active depressed and suicidal speech databases. The main focus of this paper is on how common paralinguistic speech characteristics are affected by depression and suicidality and the application of this information in classification and prediction systems. The paper concludes with an in-depth discussion on the key challenges - improving the generalisability through greater research collaboration and increased standardisation of data collection, and the mitigating unwanted sources of variability - that will shape the future research directions of this rapidly growing field of speech processing research.},

    Abstract = {In the knowledge-tracing model, error metrics are used to guide parameter estimation towards values that accurately represent students' dynamic cognitive state. We compare several metrics, including log likelihood (LL), root mean squared error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), to evaluate which metric is most suited for this purpose. LL is commonly used as an error metric in Expectation Maximization (EM) to perform parameter estimation. RMSE and AUC have been suggested but have not been explored in depth. In order to examine the effectiveness of using each metric, we measure the correlations between the values calculated by each and the distances from the corresponding points to the ground truth. Additionally, we examine how each metric compares to the others. Our findings show that RMSE is significantly better than LL and AUC. With more knowledge of effective error metrics for estimating parameters in the knowledge-tracing model,  we hope that better parameter searching algorithms can be created.}
